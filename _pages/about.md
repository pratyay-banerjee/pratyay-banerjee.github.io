About Me
========
Namoskar. I am a second year PhD student at Arizona State University, Tempe, USA working with Dr. Chitta Baral in the Natural Language Understanding and Reasoning Lab. My research interests lie in Natural language Understanding, specifically question answering and reasoning over text. I am currently working on English as the main natural language (#BenderRule). Recently I am working on solving several Multiple Choice Question Answering released by AllenAI using additional knowledge such as OpenBookQA, SocialIQA, PhysicalIQA and AbductiveNLI. I am working on improving knowledge retrieval from knowledge bases, and building neural QA models for retrieval and question answering. 


Education
========
* Bachelor of Computer Science and Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, 2014 
  * Advisor: Dr. Goutam Paul, ISI, Kolkata, India
* Ph.D in Computer Science, Arizona State University, AZ, USA, 2023 (expected)
  * Advisor: Dr. Chitta Baral, ASU, USA


Updates
========

* Our paper "Exploring ways to incorporate additional knowledge to improve Natural Language Commonsense Question Answering" shows ways to incorporate knowledge in neural language models. 

* My work on generating explanations given a question and correct answer, "Explanation ReGeneration using Language Models and Iterative Re-Ranking" ranked 2nd in the Shared Task in the Thirteenth Workshop on Graph-Based Methods for Natural Language Processing (TextGraphs-13).

* Our paper "Careful Selection of Knowledge to solve Open Book Question Answering" was accepted in 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.


Projects
========
Code for most recent projects are available in my github. 

* Mobile Computing, ASU, Spring 2019 :
 * Activity Classification using Myo Gesture Control Armband data through Machine Learning. We evaluated multiple feature generation techniques and several ML models.
* Statistical Machine Learning, ASU, Spring 2019 :
  * Improving Information Retrieval for Knowledge Extraction and Open Book Question Answering. We tested multiple IR retrieval methods using different SML models and multiple kinds of features, including features from BERT. 
* Software Security, ASU, Fall 2018 :
  * We were team AISec , which stood 2nd overall and 1st among teams who had no prior experience to CTF Attack/Defence competitions. 
* Natural Language Processing, ASU, Fall 2018:
  * Improving BiDAF for SQUAD 2.0, which had questions with no answers. 
* Undergrad Thesis at ISI, Kolkata : Fall 2013 - Spring 2014 :
  * A Graph-Based FHE based on Homomorphic Bit Vector Encoding. Evaluated multiple schemes to exploit the hardness of graph path traversal algorithms and Homomorphic Bit Vector Encoding to derive a graph based FHE scheme.
* Summer Internship at CNERG, IIT Kharagpur : Summer 2013 :  
  * Detection and analysis of dynamic communities in time varying networks. We contrasted several community detection algorithms over time varying networks, built a test bed to analyze these algorithms. Derived useful insights of few community datasets, using these implementations.
* Software Engineering Project, Jadavpur University : Summer 2012 : 
  * To find the best algorithm to identify and demarcate ringworms; an image preprocessing, segmentation, comparative algorithm analysis and implementation project. We developed a software in  MS Visual Studio suite, which processes any image and identifies possible ringworms
